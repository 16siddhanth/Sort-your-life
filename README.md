# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a simple web application that allows users to input a list of items and sort them based on the selected type. If the type is "expenses," the items are sorted in ascending order and are shown as a visual experience. If the type is "tasks," the items are sorted according to the priority assigned to each task.

## Features

- **Input Selection**: Users can select the type of items to sort (expenses or tasks).
- **Item Input**: Users can enter a comma-separated list of items.
- **Sorting**: The application sorts the items based on the selected type.
- **Visualization**: The sorted items are displayed in an animated format.

## Usage

1. **Select Type**: Choose the type of items you want to sort from the dropdown menu (expenses or tasks).
2. **Enter Items**: Input a comma-separated list of items in the text field.
   - For expenses, enter numerical values (e.g., `100, 200, 300`).
   - For tasks, enter tasks with their priorities in the format `TaskName:Priority` (e.g., `Task1:2, Task2:1`).
3. **Sort Items**: Click the "Sort Items" button to sort the items based on the selected type.
4. **View Results**: The sorted items will be displayed as an animated visualizer.
